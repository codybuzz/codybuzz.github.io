# My First Blog Post!
This is my first blog post and I am using it to test out the blog and experiment with Markdown (.md) files.

## Formatted Text
Here is an example of different formatted texts:
* *italics*,
* **bold**,
* `code font text`,
* [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

## Images
Here is an example image:
![](/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")

## Tables
Here is an example table:
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|-|-|
| A thing | Another thing |
