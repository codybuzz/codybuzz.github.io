# FastAI Course Lesson 5
## From-Scratch Model
In lesson 5 of the FastAI course I learnt the following key points:

1. Cleaning data:
* Pandas library is useful for cleaning data.
* Can use isna() to check for NaN (missing) values.
* Replacing missing values with the mode of a column works best - *works for both categorical and numerical data*
* Have to encode categorical data as numbers.

2. Linear models don't like long tail distributions
* An example of a long tail distribution can be seen below:
![](/images/long_tail_dist.png "Example of a Long Tail Distribution")
* Long tail distributions can be converted to more useful distributions using logs.

3. How to build a neural network model from scratch in python.

4. Measuring accuracy in python (different to loss function)

5. The Sigmoid function can be used to bound outputs between 0 and 1.
* An example of a sigmoid function can be seen below:

6. Use a framework!!! No need to make from scratch each time.

7. Ensembling:
* Create multiple models and combine their predictions.
* One way to do this is to create multiple of the same model, where each model has a different set of randomly initialised data.

9. Binary splits can be used to consider splits of the data for single variables.
