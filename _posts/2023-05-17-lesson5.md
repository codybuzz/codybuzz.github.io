# FastAI Course Lesson 5
## From-Scratch Model
In lesson 5 of the FastAI course I learnt the following key points:

1. Cleaning data:
* Pandas library is useful for cleaning data.
* Can use isna() to check for NaN (missing) values.
* Replacing missing values with the mode of a column works best - *works for both categorical and numerical data*
* Have to encode categorical data as numbers.

2. Linear models don't like long tail distributions
* An example of a long tail distribution can be seen below:
![](/images/long_tail_dist.png "Example of a Long Tail Distribution")
* Long tail distributions can be converted to more useful distributions using logs.

3. How to build a neural network model from scratch in python.
