# FastAI Course Lesson 8
## Convolutions (CNNs)
My key findings for Lesson 8 (CNNs) of the FastAI course are:
1. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
* Dimensionality reduction (i.e. 50 features down to 3 features).

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* CNNs are similar to other Neural Networks but they include **convolutional** layers
* Kernels are used for convolutions (kernels are like filters that slide across the 2D input and take the dot product using different weights).
* Convolution layers can extract features (i.e. edges).
* Pooling can be used to reduce the size of a layer (max pooling takes the maximum value inside of a sliding kernel)
* Strides can be used instead of max pooling (sliding convolutions but skipping some pixels).
* Can use matrix multiplication to speed up convolutions.
* Dropout can be used to make the model more *robust*.
* Dropout is a form of data augmentation for the activations.
* Dropout chooses random activations to set to 0 (or drop out).

3. Activation Functions
* Examples are ReLU, sigmoid, tanh.
